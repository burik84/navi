# navi

Use the web-browser as a navigator for documentation, instructions and diagrams. 
All information used in the project must be decomposed into folders and grouped.
Further use suggests adding new files to the appropriate category and updating links in the project.

I see the further development of the project - 
  - study and use ui/ux for convenient use
  - adaptive view
  - use React+Typescript
  - open source project
